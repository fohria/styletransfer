# styletransfer

This code is a cleaned up version of this pytorch tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html

All you need to do is change the code around line 230 to point to the style image you want to use. Then put the image(s) you want to style in the input directory. Important! Images need to be same height!

For an overview and more info check out my blog post about using styletransfer to create "Planet Ghibli"; BBC's Planet Earth styled with Studio Ghibli: https://gamescapad.es/planet-ghibli-neural-style-transfer-planet-earth-studio-ghibli-part1/
